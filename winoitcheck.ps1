# DESCRIPTION
# This tool enables an administrator to verify an ObserveIT agent installation on windows, similar to the ObserveIT linux tool oitcheck.  Currently, as of version 6.6.2 a windows diagnostic tool 
# is not provided by ObserveIT and therefore I decided to create my own to aid rollouts and/or installations by users who do not have access to the Webconsole GUI.
#
# USAGE
# ./winoitcheck.ps1
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# n/a
#
# LIMITATIONS
#
# Currently, this tool has only been confirmed wokring on Windows 2012 Server Standard running Powershell 4.0 using default ObserveIT settings.  De
